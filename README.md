__A Wordpress starter theme based on Bones and Bootstrap 3__

Created by **Dan Brown**: http://danvswild.com


I searched and searched, but I couldn't find a Wordpress starter theme that was based on Bootstrap 3 that I liked.  Most were either too bloated, or were blatantly ripping off open source code and selling it as their own.  This project is simply pulling together excellent projects such as bootstrap, wordpress, bones, etc into a simple starter theme.  

Features:
* LESS
* Bootstrap 3
* Bones framework
* sidebar and footer widgets

Planned:
* Bootstrap Page templates (full width, blog, sidebar)
* Implement Redux Framework
* Implement

* [320 Press](https://github.com/320press/wordpress-bootstrap/)
