__A Wordpress starter theme based on Bones and Bootstrap 3__

Created by **Dan Brown**: http://danvswild.com


I searched and searched, but I couldn't find a Wordpress starter theme that was based on Bootstrap 3 that I liked.  This project is simply pulling together excellent projects such as bootstrap, wordpress, bones, etc into a simple starter theme.  This is very lightweight with only some very mild CSS changes to make everything look nice out of the box.  My goal is to make this a very solid foundation for anyone wanting to develop a theme on wordpress and bootstrap.



Features:
* LESS
* Bootstrap 3
* Bones framework
* sidebar and footer widgets
* Very clean out-of-the-box experience
* pagination
* breadcrumbs (just uncomment in the page templates)
* Font Awesome 


This would not have been possible without the brilliance and hard work of so many people.  I try my best to always provide credit where credit is due.
